This project contains the code examples used in my presentation "Promises, Promises: Unlocking the Power of jQueryâ€™s Deferreds" given at jQuery San Diego, February, 2014.

You will need to have your browser console open to see the result of many of these files.

While most of the files contain fully working examples, the following contain fragments only:

* 1-badSetTimeout.html
* 2-badCounters.html
* 3-badPyramid.html

To see how 16-checkLongRunningProcess.html works, simply change the text in appLongRunningExample.txt from "done" to something else and then back to "done" when you want the process to finish.
